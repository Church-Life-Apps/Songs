[v1]
 Give me a sight, O Savior, 
 Of Thy wondrous love to me,    
 Of the love that brought Thee down to earth, 
 To die on Calvary. 
[v2]
 Was it the nails, O Savior, 
 That bound Thee to the tree?   
 Nay, it was Thine everlasting love, 
 Thy love for me, for me.
[v3]
 Oh, wonder of all wonders, 
 That through Thy death for me,  
 My open sins, my secret sins, 
 Can all forgiven be.
[v4]
 Then melt my heart, O Savior, 
 Bend me, yea, break me down, 
 Until I own Thee Conqueror, 
 And Lord and Sov’reign crown.   
[c1]
 Oh, make me understand it, 
 Help me to take it in, 
 What it meant to Thee, the Holy One, 
 To bear away my sin.

[v1]
 Here is love, vast as the ocean, 
 Loving kindness as the flood, 
 When the Prince of Life our ransom 
 Shed for us His precious blood; 
 Who His love will not remember? 
 Who can cease to sing His praise?
 He can never be forgotten 
 Thru heav’ns everlasting days.
[v2]
 On the mount of crucifixion 
 Fountains opened deep and wide; 
 Through the floodgates of God’s mercy 
 Flowed a vast and gracious tide; 
 Grace and love, like mighty rivers, 
 Poured incessant from above, 
 And heav’n’s peace and perfect justice 
 Kissed a guilty world in love.
[v3]
 Let me, all Thy love accepting, 
 Love Thee ever all my days; 
 Let me seek Thy kingdom only 
 And my life be to Thy praise; 
 Thou alone shall be my glory, 
 Nothing in the world I see. 
 Thou hast cleansed and sanctified me, 
 Thou Thyself hast set me free.
[v4]
 In Thy truth Thou dost direct me 
 By Thy Spirit through Thy Word; 
 And Thy grace my need is meeting, 
 As I trust in Thee, my Lord. 
 Of Thy fullness Thou art pouring 
 Thy great love and pow’r on me, 
 Without measure, full and boundless, 
 Drawing out my heart to Thee.

[v1]
 Thou art fairer than the morning, 
 O my Savior and my King! 
 Of Thy grandeur and Thy beauty, 
 How my soul delights to sing.
[v2]
 Clothed in light as with a garment, 
 Crowned with majesty divine, 
 Lo, the scepter of dominion 
 Now and ever, Lord, is Thine. 
[v3]
 O the greatness of Thy mercy, 
 And the richness of Thy grace! 
 O the love that in Thy kingdom 
 Is preparing me a place!
[v4]
 When at last I reach the kingdom, 
 Win the crown, the battle o’er, 
 With ten thousand times ten thousand  
 I shall sing forevermore.
[c1]
 Thou art fairer than the morning, 
 Thou art brighter, brighter than the day; 
 At the glory of Thy presence 
 Clouds and darkness flee away.

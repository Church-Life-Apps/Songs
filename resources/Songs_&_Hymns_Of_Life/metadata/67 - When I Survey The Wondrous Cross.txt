[v1]
 When I survey the wondrous cross, 
 On which the Prince of glory died, 
 My richest gain I count but loss, 
 And pour contempt on all my pride.
[v2]
 Forbid it, Lord, that I should boast,
 Save in the death of Christ my God; 
 All the vain things that charm me most, 
 I sacrifice them to His blood.
[v3]
 See, from His head, His hands, His feet,
 Sorrow and love flow mingled down; 
 Did e’er such love and sorrow meet, 
 Or thorns compose so rich a crown?
[v4]
 His dying crimson, from His head
 Spreads o’er His body on the tree;
 To all the world then am I dead,
 And all the world is dead to me.
[v5]
 Were the whole realm of nature mine, 
 That were an off’ring far too small;
 Love so amazing, so divine,
 Demands my soul, my life, my all.

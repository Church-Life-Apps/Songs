[v1]
 Full salvation! Full salvation! 
 Lo, the fountain opened wide, 
 Streams through every land and nation 
 From the Savior’s wounded side. 
 Full salvation! Full salvation! 
 Streams an endless crimson tide. 
 Streams an endless crimson tide.
[v2]
 Oh, the glorious revelation! 
 See the cleansing current flow, 
 Washing stains of condemnation 
 Whiter than the driven snow: 
 Full salvation! Full salvation! 
 Oh, the rapturous bliss to know. 
 Oh, the rapturous bliss to know.
[v3]
 Love’s resistless current sweeping 
 All the regions deep within; 
 Thought, and wish, and senses keeping 
 Now, and every instant, clean: 
 Full salvation! Full salvation! 
 From the guilt and pow’r of sin. 
 From the guilt and pow’r of sin.
[v4]
 Life immortal, Christ descending,
 Lo! my heart the Spirit’s shrine:
 God and man in oneness blending,
 Oh, what fellowship is mine!
 Full salvation! Full salvation!
 Raised in Christ to life divine!
 Raised in Christ to life divine!
[v5]
 Care and doubting, gloom and sorrow,
 Fear and shame are mine no more;
 Faith knows naught of dark tomorrow,
 For my Savior goes before:
 Full salvation! Full salvation!
 Full and free for evermore!
 Full and free for evermore!

[v1]
 My spirit, soul, and body, 
 Dear Lord, I give to Thee,
 A consecrated off’ring, 
 Thine evermore to be. 
[v2]
 O Jesus, mighty Savior, 
 I trust in Thy great name; 
 I look for Thy salvation, 
 Thy promise now I claim. 
[v3]
 Now, Lord, I yield my members, 
 From sin’s dominion free, 
 For warfare and for triumph, 
 As weapons unto Thee.
[v4]
 Oh, blissful self-surrender,
 To live, my Lord, by Thee;
 Now, Son of God, my Savior,
 Live out Thy life in me.
[v5]
 I’m Thine, O dear Lord Jesus,
 Washed in Thy precious blood,
 Sealed by Thy Holy Spirit,
 A sacrifice to God. 
[c1]
 My all is on the altar; 
 Lord, I am all Thine own; 
 Oh, may my faith ne’er falter! 
 Lord, keep me Thine alone.
[c2]
 My all is on the altar; 
 I’m waiting for the fire; 
 I’m waiting, waiting, waiting; 
 I’m waiting for the fire.

[V1]
 Come, Thou Fount of every blessing, 
 Tune my heart to sing Thy grace; 
 Streams of mercy, never ceasing, 
 Call for songs of loudest praise. 
 Jesus sought me when a stranger, 
 Wand’ring from the face of God; 
 He, to save my soul from danger, 
 Interposed His precious blood.
[V2]
 O to grace how great a debtor 
 Daily I’m constrained to be! 
 Let that grace, Lord, like a fetter,
 Bind my wand’ring heart to Thee. 
 Teach me, Lord, some rapturous measure, 
 Meet for me Thy grace to prove, 
 While I sing the countless treasure 
 Of my God’s unchanging love.
[V3]
 Prone to wander, Lord, I feel it; 
 Prone to leave the God I love; 
 Take my heart, O take and seal it 
 With Thy Spirit from above. 
 Rescued thus from sin and danger, 
 Purchased by the Savior’s blood, 
 May I walk on earth a stranger, 
 As a son and heir of God.

[v1]
 Jesus, Thy blood and righteousness 
 My beauty are, my glorious dress; 
 Midst flaming worlds in these arrayed, 
 With joy shall I lift up my head.
[v2]
 Bold shall I stand in Thy great day, 
 For who aught to my charge shall lay? 
 Fully absolved by these I am,
 From sin and fear, from guilt and shame.
[v3]
 Lord, I believe Thy precious blood, 
 Which, at the mercy seat of God, 
 Forever doth for sinners plead, 
 For me, e’en for my soul, was shed.
[v4]
 Lord, I believe were sinners more 
 Than sands upon the ocean shore, 
 Thou hast for all a ransom paid, 
 For all a full redemption made.
[v5]
 This spotless robe the same appears,
 When ruined nature sinks in years;
 No age can change its glorious hue,
 Its glory is forever new.
[v6]
 Thou God of power, Thou God of love,
 Let all Thy saints Thy mercy prove;
 Their beauty this, their glorious dress,
 Jesus the Lord, our Righteousness.

[v1]
 Once by nature we were dead in sin, 
 In a world of utter discord; 
 But together God has quickened us, 
 Raised us up to sit together with the Lord. 
[v2]
 Thus with all saints we can apprehend, 
 All the vast dimensions of God. 
 Knowing Christ’s love passes all we know, 
 We’re together filled to fullness with our God.
[v3]
 Now we know the purpose of our God, 
 Visible the mystery became: 
 Christ, the church, together now we see, 
 And together put the enemy to shame.
[v4]
 For this cause we pray the Father God— 
 Strengthen Thou with might our inner man; 
 Make Yourself at home in all our hearts, 
 Root us, ground us in Your love and for Your plan.
[v5]
 In the Body we’ll be fitly framed
 As the many members Christ supply;
 Working in the measure of each part,
 All by growth in love the Body edify.
[v6]
 Now we’re one His purpose to fulfill,
 As the one new man of His plan.
 Unto Him be glory in the church,
 And in Jesus Christ forevermore—Amen!
[c1]
 Jesus is getting us together, 
 Come and see the saints in one accord. 
 His love is knitting us together, 
 To the stature of the fullness of the Lord.

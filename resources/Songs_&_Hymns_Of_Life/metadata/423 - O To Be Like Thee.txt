[v1]
 O to be like Thee! blessed Redeemer; 
 This is my constant longing and prayer; 
 Gladly I’ll forfeit all of earth’s treasures, 
 Jesus, Thy perfect likeness to wear. 
[v2]
 O to be like Thee! full of compassion, 
 Loving, forgiving, tender and kind, 
 Helping the helpless, cheering the fainting, 
 Seeking the wand’ring sinner to find.
[v3]
 O to be like Thee! lowly in spirit, 
 Holy and harmless, patient and brave; 
 Meekly enduring cruel reproaches, 
 Willing to suffer, others to save.
[v4]
 O to be like Thee! Lord, I am coming
 Now to receive th’ anointing divine;
 All that I am and have I am bringing,
 Lord, from this moment all shall be Thine!
[v5]
 O to be like Thee! While I am pleading,
 Pour out Thy Spirit, fill with Thy love.
 Make me a temple meet for Thy dwelling,
 Fit me for life and heaven above.
[c1]
 O to be like Thee! O to be like Thee! 
 Blessed Redeemer, pure as Thou art; 
 Come in Thy sweetness, come in Thy fullness; 
 Stamp Thine own image deep on my heart.

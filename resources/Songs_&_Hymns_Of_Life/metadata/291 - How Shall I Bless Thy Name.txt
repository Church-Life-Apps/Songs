[v1]
 Master how shall I bless Thy name 
 For tender love to me, 
 For sweet enablings of Thy grace, 
 So sov’reign, yet so free, 
 That taught me to obey Thy word, 
 And cast my care on Thee?
[v2]
 No anxious thought upon thy brow 
 The watching world should see; 
 No carefulness! O child of God, 
 For nothing careful be! 
 But cast thou all thy care on Him 
 Who always cares for thee.
[v3]
 How shall I praise Thee, Savior dear, 
 For this new life so sweet, 
 For taking all the care I laid 
 At Thy beloved feet, 
 Keeping Thy hand upon my heart 
 To still each anxious beat!
[v4]
 I long to praise Thee more, and yet
 This is no care to me;
 If Thou shalt fill my mouth with songs
 Then I will sing to Thee;
 And if my silence praise Thee best,
 Then silent I will be.
[v5]
 Yet if it be Thy will, dear Lord,
 Oh, send me forth, to be
 Thy messenger to careful hearts,
 To bid them taste and see
 How good Thou art to those who cast
 All, all their care on Thee.

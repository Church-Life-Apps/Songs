[v1]
 “All things are ready,” come to the feast! 
 Come for the table now is spread; 
 Ye famishing, ye weary come, 
 And thou shalt be richly fed. 
[v2]
 “All things are ready,” come to the feast! 
 Come, for the door is open wide; 
 A place of honor is reserved 
 For you at the Master’s side.
[v3]
 “All things are ready,” come to the feast! 
 Come, while He waits to welcome thee; 
 Delay not while this day is thine, 
 Tomorrow may never be.
[v4]
 “All things are ready,” come to the feast! 
 Leave every care and worldly strife; 
 Come, feast upon the love of God 
 And drink everlasting life.
[c1]
 Hear the invitation, 
 Come whosoever will; 
 Praise God for full salvation 
 For whosoever will.

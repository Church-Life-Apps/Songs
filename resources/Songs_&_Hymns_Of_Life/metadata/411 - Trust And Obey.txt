[V1]
 When we walk with the Lord 
 In the light of His Word, 
 What a glory He sheds on our way! 
 While we do His good will 
 He abides with us still, 
 And with all who will trust and obey.
[V2]
 Not a shadow can rise, 
 Not a cloud in the skies, 
 But His smile quickly drives it away; 
 Not a doubt nor a fear, 
 Not a sigh nor a tear 
 Can abide while we trust and obey.
[V3]
 Not a burden we bear, 
 Not a sorrow we share, 
 But our toil He doth richly repay; 
 Not a grief nor a loss, 
 Not a frown nor a cross, 
 But is blest if we trust and obey.
[V4]
 But we never can prove
 The delights of His love
 Until all on the altar we lay;
 For the favor He shows
 And the joy He bestows
 Are for them who will trust and obey.
[V5]
 Then in fellowship sweet
 We will sit at His feet,
 Or we’ll walk by His side in the way;
 What He says we will do,
 Where He sends, we will go,
 Never fear, only trust and obey.
[C1]
 Trust and obey, 
 For there’s no other way 
 To be happy in Jesus, 
 But to trust and obey.

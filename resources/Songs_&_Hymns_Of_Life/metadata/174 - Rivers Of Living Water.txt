[v1]
 Rivers of living water, 
 Rivers that flow from the throne, 
 Rivers o’er-flowing with blessing, 
 Coming from Jesus alone. 
[v2]
 Whoso is thirsty come hither, 
 Here is abundant supply; 
 Water transparent as crystal, 
 Come without money and buy.
[v3]
 Cleanse me, oh, cleanse me, my Savior, 
 Make me a channel today; 
 Empty me, fill me and use me, 
 Teach me to trust and obey.
[v4]
 Then, and then only, Lord Jesus,
 Through me the rivers can flow;
 Thus and thus only will others
 Learn Thy great fulness to know.
[v5]
 Now I surrender to Jesus,
 Here I lay all at His feet;
 Anything, anywhere only,
 Just for His service made meet!
[c1]
 Rivers of living water, 
 Rivers of life so free, 
 Flowing from Thee, my Savior, 
 Send now the rivers through me.

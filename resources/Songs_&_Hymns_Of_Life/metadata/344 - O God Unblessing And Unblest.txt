[v1]
 O God, unblessing and unblest, 
 A withered plant, but not at rest, 
 A useless cumberer I’m found 
 Upon Thy field, Thy purchased ground; 
 And yet I pray— “Do not forsake me, 
 but in Thy hand, O Savior, take me.
[v2]
 As women take unbroken flax,
 As molders take unshapen wax, 
 As smith, the iron, rough and cold, 
 A useful instrument to mold, 
 So in Thy skillful hands O take me, 
 And never let Thy love forsake me.”
[v3]
 Like rock uncrushed, the stubborn will, 
 Though bearing gold is barren still; 
 Like marble in the quarry rough, 
 The natural heart is useless stuff;
 And so, I pray— “Do not forsake me, 
 But with Thy hand, O Savior break me.
[v4]
 As mortars crush the hardest rock, 
 As hammers break the stony block, 
 As millstones bruise the finest wheat, 
 As nuts are broken for their meat, 
 So with Thy mighty hand, O break me, 
 And never let Thy love forsake me.”
[v5]
 Though crushed and broken, yet I’m nought
 But fragments to the furnace brought;
 Though bruised, I have no worth to feed
 The multitudes that die in need;
 And so I pray—“Do not forsake me,
 But meet for service, Savior make me.
[v6]
 As into useful forms the ore
 From molten scraps the molders pour;
 As fire doth make the bruisèd wheat,
 When mixed and molded, fit to eat;
 So, fit for use by fire, O make me,
 And never let Thy love forsake me.”

[v1]
 How sweet the Name of Jesus sounds 
 In a believer’s ear! 
 It soothes his sorrow, heals his wounds, 
 And drives away his fear.
 And drives away his fear,
 And drives away his fear, 
 It soothes his sorrow, heals his wounds,
 And drives away his fear.
[v2]
 It makes the wounded spirit whole, 
 And calms the troubled breast; 
 ’Tis manna to the hungry soul, 
 And to the weary rest. 
 And to the weary rest, 
 And to the weary rest, 
 ’Tis manna to the hungry soul, 
 And to the weary rest.
[v3]
 Dear Name! the Rock on which I build; 
 My shield and hiding place; 
 My never-failing treasury, filled 
 With boundless stores of grace. 
 With boundless stores of grace 
 With boundless stores of grace, 
 My never-failing treasury, filled 
 With boundless stores of grace.
[v4]
 Jesus, our Savior, Shepherd, Friend, 
 Our Prophet, Priest, and King; 
 Our Lord, our Life, our Way, our End, 
 Accept the praise we bring. 
 Accept the praise we bring, 
 Accept the praise we bring, 
 Our Lord, our Life, our Way, our End, 
 Accept the praise we bring.
[v5]
 Weak is the effort of our heart,
 And cold our warmest thought;
 But when we see Thee as Thou art;
 We’ll praise Thee as we ought.
 We’ll praise Thee as we ought.
 We’ll praise Thee as we ought.
 But when we see Thee as Thou art;
 We’ll praise Thee as we ought.


[v6]
 Till then we would Thy love proclaim
 With every fleeting breath;
 And triumph in that blessed Name
 Which quells the pow’r of death.
 Which quells the pow’r of death.
 Which quells the pow’r of death.
 And triumph in that blessed Name
 Which quells the pow’r of death.

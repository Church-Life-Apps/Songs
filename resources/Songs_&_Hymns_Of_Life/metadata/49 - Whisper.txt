[v1]
 Your love and affection is sweeter than honey; 
 Your Name is an ointment most fragrant of all 
 Refreshing and soothing for me to discover; 
 Romantic and lovely, desire of all.
[v2]
 You wandered alone among sad human beings, 
 You spoke words of grace sharing Your heart of love. 
 You flowed a true balm that heals all that does ail us. 
 Despite our poor lack, You came far from above.
[v3]
 Your face like a flint, You held true to Your mission; 
 Jerusalem’s pathway You fearlessly sought. 
 Fulfilling God’s will, You delighted to do it. 
 Forsaken by God, Your blood ran from the cross.
[v4]
 You gave all for others, in darkness so hidden; 
 Your work quite completed, You lay in the grave; 
 The One who was honored was left alone quickly, 
 Asleep in a tomb in a desolate cave.
[v5]
 All hope had just vanished and prospects departed;
 The daylight had faded, the earth filled with gloom.
 Oh Lord of my life, why so quickly You perished?
 Oh Lord of my love, You departed too soon. 
[v6]
 Appearing in glory, You were manifested;
 The third day Your kindness and love was made known,
 The life of res’rrection flows out through Your loving;
 The pow'r of ascension, my reality.
[v7]
 When I gaze upon You, then all else does vanish;
 Your sweetness we taste and the world disappears.
 I bathe in Your love and I sense Your dear sweetness;
 My heart and my soul give to You all my years.

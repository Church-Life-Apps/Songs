[v1]
 I have come to the Fountain of Life,
 A fountain that flows from above; 
 I have passed from the waters of strife 
 And come to the Elim of love; 
 I have drunk of the heavenly well, 
 In the depths of my being it springs. 
 No mortal can measure or tell 
 The gladness the Comforter brings. 
[v2]
 I have come to the Fountain of Blood 
 That for guilt and uncleanness doth flow; 
 I have washed in its sin-cleansing flood 
 And my garments are whiter than snow. 
 I count not my righteousness mine— 
 ’Tis Jesus that lives in my soul. 
 I partake of His nature divine, 
 And in Him I am perfectly whole.
[v3]
 I have come to the Fountain of Health, 
 A boundless and endless supply; 
 ’Tis a secret man’s wisdom or wealth 
 Can never discover or buy. 
 But the secret my Lord hath revealed 
 In the fountain that flows from His side, 
 In the stripes by whose pain we are healed, 
 In Himself as He comes to abide.
[v4]
 I have come to the Fountain of Joy; 
 His joy is the strength of my heart. 
 My delight is unmixed with alloy, 
 My sunshine can never depart. 
 The fig tree may wither and die, 
 Earth’s pleasures and prospects decline; 
 But my fountains can never be dry— 
 My portion, my joy is divine.
[c1]
 Oh, come to the Fountain of Life, 
 The fountain that never runs dry; 
 Oh, drink of the boundless supply, 
 For God is the Fountain of Life.

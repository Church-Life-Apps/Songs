[v1]
 Jesus spreads His banner o’er us, 
 Cheers our famished souls with food; 
 He the banquet spreads before us, 
 Of His mystic flesh and blood. 
 Precious banquet, bread of heaven, 
 Wine of gladness, flowing free; 
 May we taste it, kindly given, 
 In remembrance Lord, of Thee.
[v2]
 In Thy holy incarnation, 
 When the angels sang Thy birth; 
 In Thy fasting and temptation, 
 In Thy labors on the earth, 
 In Thy trial and rejection, 
 In Thy suff’rings on the tree,
 In Thy glorious resurrection, 
 May we, Lord, remember Thee.
[v3]
 In Thy wondrous crucifixion, 
 Shunned by God, condemned by man, 
 Thou didst purchase our redemption, 
 Bridged in love the dreadful span. 
 Now to heav’n Thou hast ascended, 
 There for us to intercede; 
 Coming soon in glory splendid— 
 Blest remembrance, Lord, of Thee.

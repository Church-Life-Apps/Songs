[v1]
 Alas, and did my Savior bleed? 
 And did my Sov’reign die? 
 Would He devote that sacred head 
 For such a worm as I? 
[v2]
 Was it for sins that I had done 
 He groaned upon the tree? 
 Amazing pity! grace unknown! 
 And love beyond degree!
[v3]
 Well might the sun in darkness hide, 
 And shut His glories in, 
 When Christ, the mighty Maker, died 
 For man His creature’s sin.
[v4]
 Thus might I hide my blushing face
 While His dear cross appears,
 Dissolve my heart in thankfulness,
 And melt mine eyes to tears.
[v5]
 But drops of grief can ne’er repay
 The debt of love I owe;
 Here, Lord, I give myself away,
 ’Tis all that I can do.
[c1]
 At the cross, at the cross where I first saw the light, 
 And the burden of my heart rolled away 
 It was there by faith I received my sight, 
 And now I am happy all the day!

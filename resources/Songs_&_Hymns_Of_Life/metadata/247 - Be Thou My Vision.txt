[v1]
 Be Thou my Vision, O Lord of my heart; 
 Naught be all else to me, Save that Thou art. 
 Thou my best Thought by day or by night, 
 Waking or sleeping, Thy presence my light.
[v2]
 Be Thou my Wisdom, and Thou my true Word;
 I ever with you and you with me, Lord; 
 Thou my great Father and I Thy true son, 
 Thou in me dwelling, and I with Thee one.
[v3]
 Be Thou my battle Shield, Sword for the fight; 
 Be Thou my Dignity, Thou my Delight; 
 Thou my soul’s shelter, Thou my high tower; 
 Raise Thou me heav’enward, O pow’r of my pow’r.
[v4]
 Riches I heed not, nor man’s empty praise; 
 Thou mine Inheritance, now and always; 
 Thou and Thou only first in my heart, 
 High King of heaven, my treasure Thou art.
[v5]
 High King of heaven, my victory won, 
 May I reach heaven’s joys, O bright heav’n’s Sun! 
 Heart of my own heart, whatever befall, 
 Still be my Vision, O Ruler of all.

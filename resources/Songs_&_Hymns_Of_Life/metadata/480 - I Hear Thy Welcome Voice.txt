[v1]
 I hear Thy welcome voice, 
 That calls me, Lord, to Thee, 
 For cleansing in Thy precious blood 
 That flowed on Calvary. 
[v2]
 Though   coming weak and vile, 
 Thou dost my strength assure; 
 Thou dost my vileness fully cleanse, 
 Till spotless all, and pure.
[v3]
 ’Tis Jesus who confirms 
 The blessed work within, 
 By adding grace to welcomed grace, 
 Where reigned the pow’r of sin.
[v4]
 And He the witness gives
 To loyal hearts and free,
 That every promise is fulfilled,
 If faith but brings the plea.
[v5]
 All hail, atoning blood!
 All hail, redeeming grace!
 All hail, the gift of Christ our Lord,
 Our strength and righteousness.
[c1]
 I am coming Lord! 
 Coming now to Thee! 
 Wash me, cleanse me in the blood 
 That flowed on Calvary.

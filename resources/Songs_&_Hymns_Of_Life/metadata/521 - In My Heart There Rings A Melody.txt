[v1]
 I have a song that Jesus gave me, 
 It was sent from heav’n above 
 There never was a sweeter melody, 
 ’Tis the melody of love. 
[v2]
 I love the Christ who died on Calv’ry,
 For He washed my sins away; 
 He put within my heart a melody, 
 And I know it’s there to stay.
[v3]
 ’Twill be my endless theme in glory, 
 With the angels I will sing; 
 ’Twill be a song with glorious harmony, 
 When the courts of heaven ring.
[c1]
 In my heart there rings a melody, 
 There rings a melody with heaven’s harmony; 
 In my heart there rings a melody, 
 There rings a melody of love.

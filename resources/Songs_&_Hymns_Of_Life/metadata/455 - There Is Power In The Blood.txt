[v1]
 Would you be free from your burden of sin? 
 There’s pow’r in the blood, pow’r in the blood; 
 Would you o’er evil a victory win? 
 There’s wonderful pow’r in the blood. 
[v2]
 Would you be free from your passion and pride? 
 There’s pow’r in the blood, pow’r in the blood; 
 Come for a cleansing to Calvary’s tide, 
 There’s wonderful pow’r in the blood.
[v3]
 Would you be whiter, much whiter than snow? 
 There’s pow’r in the blood, pow’r in the blood; 
 Sin-stains are lost in its life-giving flow, 
 There’s wonderful pow’r in the blood.
[v4]
 Would you do service for Jesus your King? 
 There’s pow’r in the blood, pow’r in the blood; 
 Would you live daily His praises to sing? 
 There’s wonderful pow’r in the blood.
[c1]
 There is pow’r, pow’r, wonderworking pow’r, 
 In the blood of the Lamb; 
 There is pow’r, pow’r, wonderworking pow’r, 
 In the precious blood of the Lamb.

[v1]
 Before the throne of God above 
 I have a strong and perfect plea, 
 A great High Priest whose name is Love, 
 Who ever lives and pleads for me. 
 My name is graven on His hands, 
 My name is written on His heart.  
 I know that while in heav’n He stands, 
 No tongue can bid me thence depart, 
 No tongue can bid me thence depart.
[v2]
 When Satan tempts me to despair 
 And tells me of the guilt within, 
 Upward I look and see Him there 
 Who made an end of all my sin. 
 Because the sinless Savior died, 
 My sinful soul is counted free; 
 For God, the Just, is satisfied 
 To look on Him and pardon me, 
 To look on Him and pardon me.
[v3]
 Behold Him there, the risen Lamb! 
 My perfect, spotless Righteousness, 
 The great unchangeable I AM, 
 The King of glory and of grace.  
 One with Himself, I cannot die, 
 My soul is purchased by His blood 
 My life is hid with Christ on high, 
 With Christ, my Savior and my God, 
 With Christ, my Savior and my God.

[v1]
 O Jesus, I have promised 
 To serve Thee to the end; 
 Be Thou forever near me, 
 My Master and my Friend; 
 I shall not fear the battle 
 If Thou art by my side, 
 Nor wander from the pathway
 If Thou wilt be my guide.
[v2]
 O let me feel Thee near me, 
 The world is ever near; 
 I see the sights that dazzle, 
 The tempting sounds I hear; 
 My foes are ever near me, 
 Around me and within; 
 But, Jesus, draw Thou nearer, 
 And shield my soul from sin.
[v3]
 O let me hear Thee speaking 
 In accents clear and still; 
 Above the storms of passion, 
 The murmurs of self-will: 
 O speak to reassure me, 
 To hasten or control; 
 O speak, and make me listen, 
 Thou guardian of my soul.
[v4]
 O Jesus, Thou hast promised 
 To all who follow Thee 
 That where Thou art in glory 
 There shall Thy servant be; 
 And, Jesus, I have promised 
 To serve Thee to the end; 
 O give me grace to follow, 
 My Master and my Friend.
[v5]
 O let me see Thy footmarks, 
 And in them plant mine own; 
 My hope to follow duly 
 Is in Thy strength alone. 
 O guide me, call me, draw me, 
 Uphold me to the end; 
 And then to rest receive me, 
 My Savior and my Friend.

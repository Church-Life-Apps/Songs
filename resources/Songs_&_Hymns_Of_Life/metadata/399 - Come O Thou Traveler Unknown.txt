[v1]
 Come, O Thou Traveler unknown, 
 Whom still I hold, but cannot see; 
 My company before is gone, 
 And I am left alone with Thee; 
 With Thee all night I mean to stay, 
 And wrestle till the break of day.
[v2]
 I need not tell Thee who I am, 
 My sin and misery declare; 
 Thyself hast called me by my name, 
 Look on Thy hands, and read it there; 
 But who, I ask Thee, who art Thou? 
 Tell me Thy name, and tell me now.
[v3]
 In vain Thou strugglest to get free; 
 I never will unloose my hold! 
 Art Thou the Man that died for me? 
 The secret of Thy love unfold; 
 Wrestling, I will not let Thee go, 
 Till I Thy name, Thy nature know.
[v4]
 Yield to me now, for I am weak, 
 But confident in self-despair; 
 Speak to my heart, in blessings speak, 
 Be conquered by my instant prayer; 
 Speak, or Thou never hence shalt move, 
 And tell me if Thy name be Love.
[v5]
 ’Tis Love! ’Tis Love! Thou diedst for me!
 I hear Thy whisper in my heart;
 The morning breaks, the shadows flee;
 Pure, universal love Thou art;
 To me, to all Thy mercies move;
 Thy nature and Thy name is Love.
[v6]
 Lame as I am, I take the prey;
 Hell, earth and sin, with ease o’ercome.
 I leap for joy, pursue my way,
 And, as a bounding hart fly home,
 Through all eternity to prove
 Thy nature and Thy name is Love.

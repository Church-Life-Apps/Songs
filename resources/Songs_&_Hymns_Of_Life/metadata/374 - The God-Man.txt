[v1]
 How marv’lous, how real that my God has entered me. 
 He’s joined with my spirit; one spirit now are we. 
 My spirit was empty and dead, apart from God 
 But now I’m revived as God’s life is filling me. 
[v2]
 How rich and how full: God Himself abides in me. 
 He grows in my spirit; we’re mingling constantly. 
 I was in the world; I pursued my earthly dream 
 I now have experience of His divinity.
[v3]
 How glorious, divine: God Himself does live in me. 
 His life saturates me; one person now are we. 
 So long I have fought and endeavored by myself 
 To live now is Christ: God Himself lived out of me.
[v4]
 How heav’nly, mysterious: that God is built in me, 
 With Him constituted we’re dwelling mutually. 
 I strove with my heart to fulfill the law of God 
 But now I express all His fine humanity.
[c1]
 As Spirit He dwells gloriously. 
 Two spirits are united as one. 
 Two lives are mingled, 
 Now God and man 
 Are incorp’rated as the God-man.

[v1]
 I hear the words of love, 
 I gaze upon the blood, 
 I see the mighty sacrifice, 
 And I have peace with God.
[v2]
 ’Tis everlasting peace, 
 Sure as Jehovah’s Name; 
 ’Tis stable as His steadfast throne, 
 For evermore the same.
[v3]
 The clouds may go and come, 
 And storms may sweep my sky; 
 This blood-sealed friendship changes not, 
 The Cross is ever nigh.
[v4]
 My love is oft-times low, 
 My joy still ebbs and flows; 
 But peace with Him remains the same, 
 No change my Savior knows.
[v5]
 I change—He changes not;
 The Christ can never die;
 His love, not mine, the resting-place,
 His truth, not mine, the tie.
[v6]
 The Cross still stands unchanged,
 Though heaven is now His home;
 The mighty stone is rolled away,
 But yonder is His tomb!
[v7]
 And yonder is my peace,
 The grave of all my woes!
 I know the Son of God has come,
 I know He died and rose.
[v8]
 I know He liveth now
 At God’s right hand above;
 I know the throne on which He sits,
 I know His truth and love!

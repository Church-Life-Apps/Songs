[v1]
 How shall I follow Him I serve? 
 How shall I copy Him I love? 
 Nor from those blessed footsteps swerve, 
 Which lead me to His seat above?
[v2]
 Privations, sorrows, bitter scorn, 
 The life of toil, the mean abode, 
 The faithless kiss, the crown of thorn, 
 Are these the consecrated road?
[v3]
 Lord, should my path through suff’ring lie, 
 Forbid it I should e’er repine; 
 Still let me turn to Calvary, 
 Nor heed my griefs, rememb’ring Thine.
[v4]
 O let me think how Thou didst leave
 Untasted every pure delight,
 To fast, to faint, to watch, to grieve,
 The toilsome day, the homeless night:
[v5]
 To faint, to grieve, to die for me!
 Thou camest, not Thyself to please;
 And, dear as earthly comforts be,
 Shall I not love Thee more than these?

[v1]
 Oh, what a wonderful place 
 Jesus has given to me! 
 Saved by His glorious grace, 
 I may be even as He. 
 When with my Lord I appear, 
 Like Him I know I shall be; 
 But while I walk with Him here, 
 I may be even as He.
[v2]
 One in His death on the tree, 
 One as He rose from the dead; 
 I from the curse am as free 
 E’en as my glorious Head. 
 One on the throne by His side, 
 One in His sonship divine; 
 One as the bridegroom and bride, 
 One as the branch and the vine.
[v3]
 One in His merits I stand, 
 One as I pray in His name; 
 All that His worth can command, 
 I can with confidence claim. 
 One in His faith and His love, 
 One in His life I may be. 
 Sealed by the heavenly Dove, 
 I may be holy as He.
[v4]
 One in the rapturous hour, 
 When He shall come for His own; 
 Raised by His glorious power, 
 I shall sit down on His throne. 
 All that He has shall be mine, 
 All that He is I shall be; 
 Robed in His glory divine, 
 I shall be even as He.

[v1]
 Speak, Lord, in the stillness, 
 While I wait on Thee; 
 Hush my heart to listen, 
 In expectancy.
[v2]
 Speak, O blessed Master, 
 In this quiet hour; 
 Let me see Thy face, Lord, 
 Feel Thy touch of pow’r.
[v3]
 For the words Thou speakest, 
 “They are life” indeed; 
 Living bread from heaven, 
 Now my spirit feed!
[v4]
 All to Thee is yielded,
 I am not my own;
 Blissful, glad surrender,
 I am Thine alone!
[v5]
 Speak, Thy servant heareth!
 Be not silent, Lord;
 Waits my soul upon Thee
 For the quickening word.
[v6]
 Fill me with the knowledge
 Of Thy glorious will;
 All Thine own good pleasure
 In Thy child fulfill.
[v7]
 Like “a watered garden,”
 Full of fragrance rare,
 Lingering in Thy presence,
 Let my life appear.

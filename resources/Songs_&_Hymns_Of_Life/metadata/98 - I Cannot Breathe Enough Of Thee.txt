[v1]
 I cannot breathe enough of Thee, 
 O gentle breeze of love; 
 More fragrant than the myrtle tree 
 The Henna flower is to me, 
 The Balm of Heav’n above, 
 The Balm of Heav’n above.
[v2]
 I cannot gaze enough on Thee, 
 Thou Fairest of the Fair; 
 My heart is filled with ecstasy, 
 As in Thy face of radiancy 
 I see such beauty there, 
 I see such beauty there.
[v3]
 I cannot yield enough to Thee, 
 My Savior, Master, Friend; 
 I do not wish to go out free, 
 But ever, always, willingly, 
 To serve Thee to the end, 
 To serve Thee to the end.
[v4]
 I cannot sing enough of Thee,
 The sweetest name on earth;
 A note so full of melody
 Comes from my heart so joyously,
 And fills my soul with mirth,
 And fills my soul with mirth.
[v5]
 I cannot speak enough of Thee,
 I have so much to tell;
 Thy heart it beats so tenderly
 As Thou dost draw me close to Thee,
 And whisper, “All is well,”
 And whisper, “All is well.”

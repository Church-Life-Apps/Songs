[v1]
 A debtor to mercy alone, 
 Of covenant mercy I sing; 
 Nor fear, with God’s righteousness on, 
 My person and off’ring to bring. 
 The terrors of law and of God 
 With me can have nothing to do; 
 My Savior’s obedience and blood 
 Hide all my transgressions from view.
[v2]
 The work which His goodness began, 
 The arm of His strength will complete; 
 His promise is Yea and Amen, 
 And never was forfeited yet. 
 Things future, nor things that are now, 
 Not all things below or above, 
 Can make Him His purpose forego, 
 Or sever my soul from His love.
[v3]
 My name from the palms of His hands 
 Eternity will not erase; 
 Impressed on His heart, it remains 
 In marks of indelible grace. 
 Yes! I to the end shall endure, 
 As sure as the earnest is giv’n; 
 More happy, but not more secure, 
 The glorified spirits in heav’n.

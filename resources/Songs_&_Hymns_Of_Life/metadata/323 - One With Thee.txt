[v1]
 I am one with Thee, Lord Jesus, 
 One in spirit now with Thee; 
 All Thyself I now possess, Lord, 
 All Thou art now lives in me. 
[v2]
 Now I share Thy human life, Lord. 
 Filled with Thy humanity, 
 All of Thy complete obedience 
 Is available to me.
[v3]
 One with Thee in crucifixion, 
 On the cross I died in Thee; 
 I am dead unto the world, Lord,
 And the world is dead to me.
[v4]
 One with Thee in resurrection, 
 Risen now to live in Thee, 
 With that life which is Thyself, Lord, 
 Now in me, Lord, even me.
[v5]
 One with Thee in Thine ascension,
 In the heavens now with Thee;
 Here a pilgrim and a stranger,
 My true life is hid in Thee.
[v6]
 One with Thee in Thine enthronement,
 Sharing Thine authority,
 Even as I share Thy life, Lord,
 I in Thee and Thou in me.
[c1]
 One with Thee, one with Thee, 
 One with Thee, one with Thee; 
 Day by day I share Thy riches, 
 Thou art everything to me.

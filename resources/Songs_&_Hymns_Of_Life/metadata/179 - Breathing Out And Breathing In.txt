[v1]
 O Lord, breathe Thy Spirit on me, 
 Teach me how to breath Thee in; 
 Help me pour into Thy bosom 
 All my life of self and sin.
[v2]
 I am breathing out my own life, 
 That I may be filled with Thine; 
 Letting go my strength and weakness, 
 Breathing in Thy life divine.
[v3]
 Breathing out my sinful nature, 
 Thou hast borne it all for me; 
 Breathing in Thy cleansing fulness, 
 Finding all my life in Thee.
[v4]
 I am breathing out my sorrow,
 On Thy kind and gentle breast;
 Breathing in Thy joy and comfort,
 Breathing in Thy peace and rest.
[v5]
 I am breathing out my sickness,
 Thou hast borne its burden too;
 I am breathing in Thy healing,
 Ever promised, ever new.
[v6]
 I am breathing out my longings
 In Thy listening, loving ear;
 I am breathing in Thy answers,
 Stilling every doubt and fear.
[v7]
 I am breathing every moment,
 Drawing all my life from Thee;
 Breath by breath I live upon Thee,
 Blesséd Spirit breathe in me.
[c1]
 I am breathing out my sorrow, 
 Breathing out my sin; 
 I am breathing, breathing, breathing, 
 All Thy fulness in.

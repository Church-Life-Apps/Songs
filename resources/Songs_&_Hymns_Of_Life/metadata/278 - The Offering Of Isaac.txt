[v1]
 With difficulty I forward tread 
 Near to the side of my beloved; 
 Within my heart does sorrow flow 
 Knowing our journey soon must end; 
 Shoulder to shoulder I meditate, 
 How he’s the focus of my life. 
[v2]
 I see the wood   he bears for the pyre; 
 I hold the torch, the blade in hand; 
 His questioning does grieve my soul, 
 And his dear sweetness breaks my heart; 
 Many a year in my bosom lay 
 Treasured by God, admired by men. 
[v3]
 My God, what strange design has moved 
 You to demand this offering? 
 Common as I, I ne’er dared hope 
 Pledged by You for my aging days; 
 It is Yourself come forward to give 
 With Your appearing You promised to me
[v4]
 As in a dream I walk, and yet
 By cov’nant, Your provision know; 
 But my own hands the altar raise; 
 Wood I lay up, my son I bind.  
 I know that once this moment’s gone, 
 All gain will vanish by my own blow. 
[v5]
 Why o’er and o’er have You appeared, 
 Drawn me to gain the promised land? 
 Why have You promised blessing to me, 
 Given this land e’en to my seed? 
 Why have You named me Abraham, 
 Granted me faith and righteousness?
[v6]
 I’m just a common man on earth, 
 And every step I take seems hard. 
 Your loving hand, not letting go, 
 Draws me to walk this path of faith. 
 Wand’ring alone, my body dead, 
 I out of death to life was led. 
[v7]
 Remember, Lord, Your promises; 
 Do You forget Your doings or plan? 
 Remember how You spoke to me, 
 Caused me to wander in this land. 
 Now You took him who made it all real; 
 Replacing him with Yourself alone.
[v8]
 I raise my hand, I clench the blade, 
 Eyes full of tears, t’ward my beloved; 
 Son, once I promised all to you, 
 Knowing you are God’s top desire. 
 Now I must give you back to God; 
 You I must kill with my own hand.
[v9]
 Where now my way, where now my hope. 
 All that I am has ended here. 
 Appearings, promises all past; 
 Experience, gifts remembered not. 
 Only my God, this glorious God, 
 My goal, my portion, my treasure, my all.

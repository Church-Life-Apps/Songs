[v1]
 Just as I am, without one plea, 
 But that Thy blood was shed for me, 
 And that Thou bid’st me come to Thee, 
 O Lamb of God, I come, I come!
[v2]
 Just as I am, and waiting not 
 To rid my soul of one dark blot; 
 To Thee whose blood can cleanse each spot, 
 O Lamb of God, I come, I come!
[v3]
 Just as I am, though tossed about 
 With many a conflict many a doubt; 
 Fightings and fears within, without, 
 O Lamb of God, I come, I come!
[v4]
 Just as I am, poor, wretched, blind;
 Sight, riches, healing of the mind;
 Yes, all I need, in Thee to find,
 O Lamb of God, I come, I come!
[v5]
 Just as I am, Thou wilt receive,
 Wilt welcome, pardon, cleanse, relieve;
 Because Thy promise I believe,
 O Lamb of God, I come, I come!
[v6]
 Just as I am, Thy love unknown
 Has broken every barrier down;
 Now, to be Thine, yea, Thine alone,
 O Lamb of God, I come, I come!

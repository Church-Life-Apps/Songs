[v1]
 Loved with everlasting love, 
 Led by grace that love to know; 
 Gracious Spirit from above, 
 Thou hast taught me it is so. 
 Oh, this full and perfect peace! 
 Oh, this transport all divine! 
 In a love which cannot cease, 
 I am His, and He is mine.
[v2]
 Heav’n above is softer blue, 
 Earth around is sweeter green; 
 Something lives in every hue 
 Christless eyes have never seen: 
 Birds with gladder songs o’erflow, 
 Flow’rs with deeper beauties shine, 
 Since I know, as now I know, 
 I am His, and He is mine.
[v3]
 Things that once were wild alarms 
 Cannot now disturb my rest; 
 Closed in everlasting arms, 
 Pillowed on the loving breast. 
 Oh, to lie forever here, 
 Doubt and care and self resign, 
 While He whispers in my ear, 
 I am His, and He is mine.
[v4]
 His forever, only His: 
 Who the Lord and me shall part? 
 Ah, with what a rest of bliss 
 Christ can fill the loving heart. 
 Heav’n and earth may fade and flee, 
 Firstborn light in gloom decline; 
 But, while God and I shall be, 
 I am His, and He is mine.

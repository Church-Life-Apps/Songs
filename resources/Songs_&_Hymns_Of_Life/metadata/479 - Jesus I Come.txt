[v1]
 Out of my bondage, sorrow, and night, 
 Jesus, I come! Jesus, I come! 
 Into Thy freedom, gladness, and light, 
 Jesus, I come to Thee! 
 Out of my sickness into Thy health, 
 Out of my want and into Thy wealth, 
 Out of my sin and into Thyself, 
 Jesus, I come to Thee!
[v2]
 Out of my shameful failure and loss, 
 Jesus, I come! Jesus, I come! 
 Into the glorious gain of Thy cross, 
 Jesus, I come to Thee! 
 Out of earth’s sorrows into Thy balm, 
 Out of life’s storm and into Thy calm, 
 Out of distress to jubilant psalm, 
 Jesus, I come to Thee!
[v3]
 Out of unrest and arrogant pride, 
 Jesus, I come! Jesus, I come! 
 Into Thy blessed will to abide, 
 Jesus, I come to Thee! 
 Out of myself to dwell in Thy love, 
 Out of despair into raptures above, 
 Upward for aye on wings like a dove, 
 Jesus, I come to Thee!
[v4]
 Out of the fear and dread of the tomb, 
 Jesus, I come! Jesus, I come! 
 Into the joy and pleasure, Thine own, 
 Jesus, I come to Thee! 
 Out of the depths of ruin untold, 
 Into the flock Thy love doth enfold, 
 Ever Thy glorious face to behold, 
 Jesus, I come to Thee!

[v1]
 Hast thou heard Him, seen Him, known Him?
 Is not thine a captured heart? 
 Chief among ten thousand own Him; 
 Joyful choose the better part. 
[v2]
 Idols once they won thee, charmed thee, 
 Lovely things of time and sense; 
 Gilded thus does sin disarm thee, 
 Honeyed lest thou turn thee thence.
[v3]
 What has stripped the seeming beauty 
 From the idols of the earth? 
 Not a sense of right or duty, 
 But the sight of peerless worth.
[v4]
 Not the crushing of those idols, 
 With its bitter void and smart;
 But the beaming of His beauty,
 The unveiling of His heart.
[v5]
 Who extinguishes their taper
 Till they hail the rising sun?
 Who discards the garb of winter
 Till the summer has begun?
[v6]
 ’Tis that look that melted Peter,
 ’Tis that face that Stephen saw,
 ’Tis that heart that wept with Mary,
 Can alone from idols draw:
[v7]
 Draw and win and fill completely,
 Till the cup o’erflow the brim;
 What have we to do with idols
 Who have companied with Him?
[c1]
 Captivated by His beauty, 
 Worthy tribute haste to bring; 
 Let His peerless worth constrain thee, 
 Crown Him now unrivaled King.

[v1]
 His angels His countenance always behold, 
 But never experience His grace; 
 His saints, while they know His unlimited love, 
 Have never yet looked on His face. 
 Yet soon they will rise and His visage behold, 
 The sight of His glory will gain; 
 But Mary, beholding His tears as He wept, 
 Could see His heart’s anguish and pain, 
 Could see His heart’s anguish and   pain.
[v2]
 We soon will see Jesus, our Lord, face to face, 
 We’ll know Him as never before; 
 But then we’ll no longer need His tender hand 
 To heal a heart broken and sore. 
 In heaven we’ll offer Him praise without end— 
 No praying or tears needed there, 
 Nor ever a burden to roll on our Friend, 
 Or place for our burdensome prayers, 
 Or place for our burdensome prayers.
[v3]
 In heavenly glory, that day we’ll be crowned 
 And nevermore carry a cross. 
 ’Tis only on earth where our Lord was disowned 
 We share His rejection and loss. 
 When entering rest in that morning so fair, 
 Our anguish and trials will end; 
 His sorrow and shame we'll no more with Him share, 
 Or sacrifice pleasures for Him, 
 Or sacrifice pleasures for   Him.
[v4]
 Alas, we are left with few chances to share, 
 To learn, and to taste of His grief. 
 Yet still for His sake His reproach we may bear— 
 Such times we can never retrieve. 
 Reviling and scorn shall we still here bemoan 
 When soon they no longer will be? 
 I treasure these temporal blessings I’ve known, 
 For thus, Lord, I’m made one with Thee, 
 For thus, Lord, I’m made one with   Thee. 
[v5]
 I long, Lord, to gaze on Thy wonderful face—
 ’Tis better by far Thee to meet.
 But now I would choose Thy dear suffering grace
 And not miss such fellowship sweet.
 Have mercy on me; fill me, Lord, with Thy love
 To live for Thee here at all cost.
 Lest earnestly seeking a heaven above
 I then regret chances were lost,
 I then regret chances were lost.

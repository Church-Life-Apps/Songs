[v1]
 Rescue the perishing, 
 Care for the dying, 
 Snatch them in pity from sin and the grave; 
 Weep o’er the erring one, 
 Lift up the fallen, 
 Tell them of Jesus the mighty to save. 
[v2]
 Though they are slighting Him, 
 Still He is waiting, 
 Waiting the penitent child to receive; 
 Plead with them earnestly, 
 Plead with them gently; 
 He will forgive if they only believe.
[v3]
 Down in the human heart, 
 Crushed by the tempter, 
 Feelings lie buried that grace can restore; 
 Touched by a loving heart, 
 Wakened by kindness, 
 Chords that are broken will vibrate once more.
[v4]
 Rescue the perishing, 
 Duty demands it;
 Strength for thy labor the Lord will provide; 
 Back to the narrow way 
 Patiently win them; 
 Tell the poor wand’rer a Savior has died.
[c1]
 Rescue the perishing, 
 Care for the dying; 
 Jesus is merciful, 
 Jesus will save.

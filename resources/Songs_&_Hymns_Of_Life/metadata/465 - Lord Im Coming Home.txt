[v1]
 I’ve wandered far away from God, 
 Now I’m coming home; 
 The paths of sin too long I’ve trod, 
 Lord, I’m coming home. 
[v2]
 I’ve wasted many precious years, 
 Now I’m coming home; 
 I now repent with bitter tears, 
 Lord, I’m coming home.
[v3]
 I’m tired of sin and straying, Lord, 
 Now I’m coming home; 
 I’ll trust Thy love, believe Thy word; 
 Lord, I’m coming home.
[v4]
 My soul is sick, my heart is sore, 
 Now I’m coming home; 
 My strength renew, my hope restore: 
 Lord, I’m coming home.
[v5]
 My only hope, my only plea,
 Now I’m coming home;
 That Jesus died, and died for me;
 Lord, I’m coming home.
[v6]
 I need His cleansing blood, I know,
 Now I’m coming home;
 O wash me whiter than the snow;
 Lord, I’m coming home.
[c1]
 Coming home, coming home, 
 Nevermore to roam; 
 Open wide Thine arms of love; 
 Lord, I’m coming home.

[v1]
 Lord, I would have Thyself in all Thy beauty, 
 Take Thou control of all my life just now; 
 In Thee to live, and move, and have my being, 
 With full abandon, Lord, to Thee I bow. 
[v2]
 Show me the things of which I am unconscious, 
 Lord, put Thy finger now upon my heart; 
 Whisper to me, through Thy blest Holy Spirit, 
 Tell me what grieves Him, that it may depart.
[v3]
 Thou art my Victor over keen temptation, 
 Thou art my Shield, to meet the darts of sin; 
 Lord Jesus, Thou alone can keep me trusting, 
 And living out Thy glorious life within.
[c1]
 Thy blood was shed to cleanse from sin, Lord Jesus, 
 Thy risen life transforms the old to new; 
 I take my stand upon Thy word of promise: 
 Sin shall not have dominion over you!

[V1]
 Who is He in yonder stall, 
 At whose feet the shepherds fall? 
 Who is He in deep distress, 
 Fasting in the wilderness?
[V2]
 Who is He the people bless 
 For His words of gentleness? 
 Who is He to whom they bring 
 All the sick and sorrowing?
[V3]
 Who is He who stands and weeps 
 At the grave where Laz’rus sleeps?  
 Who is He the gath’ring throng 
 Greet with loud triumphant song?
[V4]
 Lo! at midnight, who is He
 Prays in dark Gethsemane?
 Who is He on yonder tree
 Dies in grief and agony?
[V5]
 Who is He who from the grave
 Comes to heal, and help, and save?
 Who is He who from His throne
 Rules through all the world alone?
[C1]
 ’Tis the Lord! oh wondrous story! 
 ’Tis the Lord! the King of glory! 
 At His feet we humbly fall, 
 Crown Him! crown Him, Lord of all!

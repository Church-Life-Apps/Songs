[v1]
 I need Thee, precious Jesus! 
 For I am full of sin; 
 My soul is dark and guilty, 
 My spirit dead within: 
 I need the cleansing fountain, 
 Where I can always flee: 
 The blood of Christ most precious, 
 The sinner’s perfect plea.
[v2]
 I need Thee, precious Jesus! 
 For I am very poor; 
 A stranger and a pilgrim, 
 I have no earthly store: 
 I need the love of Jesus, 
 To cheer me on my way, 
 To guide my doubting footsteps, 
 To be my strength and stay.
[v3]
 I need Thee, precious Jesus! 
 I need a friend like Thee; 
 A friend to soothe and comfort,
 A friend to care for me: 
 I need the heart of Jesus, 
 To feel each anxious care, 
 To bear my every burden, 
 And all my sorrow share.
[v4]
 I need Thee, precious Jesus!
 I need Thee day by day,
 To fill me with Thy fulness,
 To lead me on my way;
 I need Thy Holy Spirit,
 To teach me what I am;
 To show me more of Jesus,
 To point me to the Lamb.
[v5]
 I need Thee, precious Jesus!
 And hope to see Thee soon,
 Encircled with Thy glory,
 And seated on Thy throne;
 There with Thy blood-bought people,
 My joy shall ever be
 To praise Thee, precious Jesus,
 To gaze, my Lord, on Thee.

[v1]
 Some day the silver cord will break, 
 And I no more as now shall sing; 
 But, O the joy when I shall wake 
 Within the presence of the King! 
[v2]
 Some day my earthly house will fall, 
 I cannot tell how soon ’twill be, 
 But this I know— my All in all 
 Has now a place with Him for me.  
[v3]
 Or some day when my Lord will come, 
 And called to meet Him I’ll be blest, 
 He then will say to me, “Well done,” 
 And I shall enter into rest.
[v4]
 Some day, till then I’ll watch and wait, 
 My lamp all trimmed and burning bright, 
 That when my Savior I will greet, 
 My faith will then be changed to sight.
[c1]
 And I shall see Him face to face, 
 And tell the story, saved by grace: 
 And I shall see Him face to face, 
 And tell the story, saved by grace.

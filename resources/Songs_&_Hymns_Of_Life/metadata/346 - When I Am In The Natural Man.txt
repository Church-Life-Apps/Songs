[v1]
 When I am in the natural man, 
 How very strong I feel I am, 
 I do not know, I cannot scan 
 How very weak I am.
[v2]
 When in the world I have my life, 
 I cannot sense my failure rife, 
 But boasting in my earnest strife, 
 Proudly, I forward press.
[v3]
 When I within the darkness dwell, 
 My shallow state I cannot tell, 
 I only think how I excel, 
 Needing no modesty.
[v4]
 But when at last I come to Thee, 
 Thy searching light uncovers me, 
 I see what I could never see— 
 My ugly self exposed.
[v5]
 Withering beneath Thy scorching ray,
 I find my all fading away,
 My self-esteem in dust I lay,
 My weakness I embrace.
[v6]
 There’s not a thing that pride can claim,
 There’s not a member but is lame,
 There’s only deep regret and shame,
 O Lord, how can I pray?
[v7]
 Thy blood from judgment sets me free,
 Thy life from doom delivers me.
 How filthy yet I still must be,
 In shame my head I bow.
[v8]
 In blindness I’m puffed up with pride,
 Thinking no need the facts to hide.
 My self-conceit has multiplied,
 While I in darkness boast.
[v9]
 Whether I stay or move along,
 Whate’er I say, I’m always wrong!
 So weak am I and never strong,
 Nothing I do is right.
[v10]
 I want to pray, but faith have not,
 I fain would seek Thee as Thou art.
 Oh, canst Thou e’er renew my heart,
 Have mercy, Lord, on me!

[v1]
 O Jesus, Jesus, dearest Lord! 
 Forgive me if I say, 
 For very love, Thy sacred name 
 A thousand times a day. 
[v2]
 I love Thee so I know not how 
 My transports to control; 
 Thy love is like a burning fire 
 Within my very soul.
[v3]
 For Thou to me art all in all; 
 My honor and my wealth; 
 My heart’s desire, my body’s strength, 
 My soul’s eternal health.
[v4]
 Burn, burn, O love, within my heart, 
 Burn fiercely night and day, 
 Till all the dross of earthly loves
 Is burned, and burned away.
[v5]
 O light in darkness, joy in grief,
 O heaven’s life on earth;
 Jesus, my love, my treasure, who
 Can tell what Thou art worth?
[v6]
 What limit is there to this love?
 Thy flight, where wilt Thou stay?
 On, on! our Lord is sweeter far
 Today than yesterday.
[c1]
 O Jesus, Lord, with me abide; 
 I rest in Thee, whate’er betide; 
 Thy gracious smile is my reward;
 I love, I love Thee, Lord!

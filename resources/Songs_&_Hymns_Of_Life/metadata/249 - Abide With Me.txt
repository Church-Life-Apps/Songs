[v1]
 Abide with me! Fast falls the eventide; 
 The darkness deepens; Lord, with me abide! 
 When other helpers fail, and comforts flee, 
 Help of the helpless, O, abide with me!
[v2]
 Swift to its close ebbs out life’s little day; 
 Earth’s joys grow dim, its glories pass away. 
 Change and decay in all around I see; 
 O Thou, who changest not, abide with me!
[v3]
 Come not in terrors, as the King of kings; 
 But kind and good, with healing in Thy wings: 
 Tears for all woes, a heart for every plea; 
 Come, Friend of sinners, and abide with me!
[v4]
 I need Thy presence every passing hour: 
 What but Thy grace can foil the tempter’s power? 
 Who like Thyself my guide and stay can be? 
 Through cloud and sunshine, O, abide with me!
[v5]
 I fear no foe, with Thee at hand to bless:
 Ills have no weight, and tears no bitterness:
 Where is death’s sting? Where, grave, thy victory?
 I triumph still, if Thou abide with me!
[v6]
 Reveal Thyself before my closing eyes;
 Shine through the gloom, and point me to the skies:
 Heaven’s morning breaks, and earth’s vain shadows flee;
 In life, in death, O Lord, abide with me!

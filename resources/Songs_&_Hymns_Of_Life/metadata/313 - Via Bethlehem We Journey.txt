[v1]
 Via Bethlehem we journey, 
 We whose hearts on God are set; 
 Babe-like souls of Jesus learning, 
 While our cheeks with tears are wet; 
 For the manger and the stable 
 Are not pleasant to our eyes, 
 But our feet must follow Jesus, 
 If our hands would grasp the prize.
[v2]
 Via Nazareth! the pathway 
 Narrows still as on we go, 
 Years of toil none understanding, 
 Yet God teaches us to know 
 That the servant is not greater 
 Than the Lord, who thro’ long years 
 Hid Himself from this world’s glory, 
 Follow Him! Count not the tears.
[v3]
 Via Galilee, we see Him! 
 Stones are hurled, and curses hissed 
 By the men who gather round Him, 
 Has He not the pathway missed? 
 No! unharmed the Savior passes, 
 And this rough bit of the way 
 We must travel, since like Jesus, 
 Nothing can our purpose stay.
[v4]
 Via too, the awful anguish 
 Of the hours beneath the trees,
 Where the hosts of Satan linger, 
 Awful hours of anguish these! 
 Yet we fail not, for God’s angels, 
 Minister to us, and say, 
 “Look, beloved, at the glory, 
 Conflict is but for a day!”
[v5]
 Then the Cross! For via Calvary
 Every royal soul must go;
 Here we draw the veil, for Jesus
 Only can the pathway show;
 If we suffer with Him, listen,
 Just a little, little while,
 And the memory will have faded
 In the glory of His smile!
[v6]
 Then the grave, with dear ones weeping,
 Knowing that all life has fled;
 (Fellow-pilgrims, art thou numbered
 With the men the world calls dead?)
 Thence we rise, and live with Jesus,
 Throned above the world’s mad strife,
 Gladly forfeiting forever,
 All that worldings count as life.
[v7]
 On we press! and yonder gleaming,
 Nearing every day, we see
 The great walls of that fair city,
 God has built for such as we;
 And we catch the tender music
 Of the choirs that sing of One
 Who once died to have us with Him
 In His kingdom, on the throne. 
[v8]
 Just a few more miles, beloved!
 And our feet shall ache no more;
 No more sin, and no more sorrow,
 Hush thee, Jesus went before;
 And I hear Him sweetly whispering,
 “Faint not, fear not, still press on,
 For it may be ere tomorrow,
 The long journey will be done.”

[v1]
 Lord Jesus, I long to be perfectly whole, 
 I want Thee forever to live in my soul; 
 Break down every idol, cast out every foe; 
 Now wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow. 
[v2]
 Lord Jesus, let nothing unholy remain, 
 Apply Thine own blood and extract every stain; 
 To get this blest cleansing I all things forego; 
 Now wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.
[v3]
 Lord Jesus, look down from Thy throne in the skies, 
 And help me to make a complete sacrifice; 
 I give up myself and whatever I know; 
 Now wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.
[v4]
 Lord Jesus, for this I most humbly entreat; 
 I wait, blessed Lord, at Thy crucified feet; 
 By faith, for my cleansing I see Thy blood flow; 
 Now wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.
[v5]
 Lord Jesus, Thou seest I patiently wait;
 Come now, and within me a new heart create;
 To those who have sought Thee, Thou never saidst No—
 Now wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.
[v6]
 The blessing by faith, I receive from above;
 Oh, glory! My soul is made perfect in love;
 My prayer has prevailed, and this moment I know,
 The blood is applied, I am whiter than snow.
[c1]
 Whiter than snow; yes, whiter than snow; 
 Now wash me and I shall be whiter than snow.

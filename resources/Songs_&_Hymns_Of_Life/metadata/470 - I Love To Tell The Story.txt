[v1]
 I love to tell the story 
 Of unseen things above, 
 Of Jesus and His glory, 
 Of Jesus and His love. 
 I love to tell the story, 
 Because I know ’tis true; 
 It satisfies my longings 
 As nothing else can do. 
[v2]
 I love to tell the story; 
 More wonderful it seems 
 Than all the golden fancies 
 Of all my golden dreams. 
 I love to tell the story, 
 It did so much for me; 
 And that is just the reason 
 I tell it now to thee.
[v3]
 I love to tell the story; 
 ’Tis pleasant to repeat 
 What seems each time I tell it, 
 More wonderfully sweet. 
 I love to tell the story; 
 For some have never heard 
 The message of salvation 
 From God’s own holy Word.
[v4]
 I love to tell the story; 
 For those who know it best 
 Seem hungering and thirsting 
 To hear it like the rest. 
 And when, in scenes of glory, 
 I sing the new, new song, 
 ’Twill be the old, old story, 
 That I have loved so long.
[c1]
 I love to tell the story, 
 ’Twill be my theme in glory 
 To tell the old, old story 
 Of Jesus and His love.

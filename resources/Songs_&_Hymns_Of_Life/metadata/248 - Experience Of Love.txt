[v1]
 O Jesus Lord, how I wish to depart, 
 I am so vile and weak; 
 And why Beloved, is Your hand stayed on me 
 when in darkness I stay? 
 In Your love, so wonderful and marvelous, 
 I can see no shadow turning there.
 In Your love, so wonderful and marvelous, 
 I can see no shadow turning there.
[v2]
 O Jesus Lord, how can I follow You, 
 all around is a maze; 
 And Jesus Lord, how can I forward go; 
 where is Your footprint clear? 
 Is there reason why I still can see Your face, 
 with my failings, and such pow’rlessness? 
 Is there reason why I still can see Your face, 
 with my failings, and such pow’rlessness?
[v3]
 O Jesus Lord, let me part from this way, 
 it is frightfully dark; 
 And Jesus Lord, hide Your face from me now, 
 everywhere I’m perplexed. 
 Yet You search my inmost being thoroughly, 
 Still You see I long to be with You; 
 Yet You search my inmost being thoroughly, 
 Still You see I long to be with You.
[v4]
 O Jesus Lord, lead me now to abide. 
 You’re the fountain of love; 
 And Jesus, lead me to walk all the way; 
 You are my true delight. 
 Though I want to leave You, running far away, 
 Yet I know that truly I’m in You; 
 Though I want to leave You, running far away, 
 Yet I know that truly I’m in You.

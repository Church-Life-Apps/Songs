[v1]
 Down at the cross where my Savior died, 
 Down where for cleansing from sin I cried, 
 There to my sin was the blood applied; 
 Glory to His name! 
[v2]
 I am so wondrously saved from sin,
 Jesus so sweetly abides within; 
 There at the cross where He took me in;
 Glory to His name! 
[v3]
 Oh, precious fountain that saves from sin, 
 I am so glad I have entered in; 
 There Jesus saves me and keeps me clean;
 Glory to His name! 
[v4]
 Come to this fountain so rich and sweet; 
 Cast thy poor soul at the Savior’s feet; 
 Plunge in today, and be made complete;
 Glory to His name! 
[c1]
 Glory to His name, Glory to His name; 
 There to my sin was the blood applied; 
 Glory to His name!

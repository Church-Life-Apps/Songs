[v1]
 Spirit of God, descend upon my heart; 
 Wean it from earth, through all its pulses move; 
 Stoop to my weakness, mighty as Thou art, 
 And make me love Thee as I ought to love.
[v2]
 I ask no dream, no prophet ecstasies, 
 No sudden rending of the veil of clay, 
 No angel visitant, no opening skies; 
 But take the dimness of my soul away.
[v3]
 Hast Thou not bid us love Thee, God and King? 
 All, all Thine own, soul, heart and strength and mind.
 I see Thy cross; there teach my heart to cling. 
 Oh, let me seek Thee, and, oh, let me find!
[v4]
 Teach me to feel that Thou art always nigh; 
 Teach me the struggles of the soul to bear,
 To check the rising doubt, the rebel sigh;
 Teach me the patience of unanswered prayer.
[v5]
 Teach me to love Thee with a virgin love,
 One holy passion filling all my frame;
 Thus all the riches of Thyself to prove,
 My heart an altar, and Thy love the flame.

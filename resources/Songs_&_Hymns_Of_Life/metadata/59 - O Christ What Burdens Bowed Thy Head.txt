[v1]
 O Christ, what burdens bowed Thy head! 
 Our load was laid on Thee; 
 Thou stoodest in the sinner’s stead, 
 Didst bear all ill for me. 
 A victim led; Thy blood was shed; 
 Now there’s no load for me.
[v2]
 Death and the curse were in our cup, 
 O Christ, ’twas full for Thee! 
 But Thou hast drained the last dark drop,  
 ’Tis empty now for me. 
 That bitter cup, love drank it up; 
 Now blessing’s draught for me.
[v3]
 Jehovah lifted up His rod, 
 O Christ, it fell on Thee! 
 Thou wast sore stricken of Thy God; T
 There’s not one stroke for me. 
 Thy tears, Thy blood, beneath it flowed; 
 Thy bruising healeth me.
[v4]
 The tempest’s awful voice was heard, 
 O Christ, it broke on Thee! 
 Thy open bosom was my ward, 
 It braved the storm for me. 
 Thy form was scarred, Thy visage marred; 
 Now cloudless peace for me.
[v5]
 Jehovah bade His sword awake,
 O Christ, it woke ’gainst Thee!
 Thy blood the flaming blade must slake; 
 Thy heart its sheath must be;
 All for my sake, my peace to make;
 Now sleeps that sword for me.
[v6]
 For me, Lord Jesus, Thou hast died,
 And I have died in Thee;
 Thou’rt ris’n—my bands are all untied,
 And now Thou liv’st in me.
 When purified, made white, and tried,
 Thy glory then for me!

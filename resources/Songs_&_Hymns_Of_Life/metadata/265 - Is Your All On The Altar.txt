[v1]
 You have longed for sweet peace, and for faith to increase, 
 And have earnestly, fervently prayed; 
 But you cannot have rest, or be perfectly blest, 
 Until all on the altar is laid. 
[v2]
 Would you walk with the Lord in the light of His Word, 
 And have peace and contentment alway? 
 You must do His sweet will to be free from all ill; 
 On the altar your all you must lay.
[v3]
 Oh, we never can know what the Lord will bestow 
 Of the blessings for which we have prayed, 
 Till our body and soul He doth fully control, 
 And our all on the altar is laid.
[v4]
 Who can tell all the love He will send from above! 
 Oh, how happy our heart will be made! 
 Oh, what fellowship sweet we shall share at His feet, 
 When our all on the altar is laid!
[c1]
 Is your all on the altar of sacrifice laid? 
 Your heart, does the Spirit control? 
 You can only be blest and have peace and sweet rest, 
 As you yield Him your body and soul.

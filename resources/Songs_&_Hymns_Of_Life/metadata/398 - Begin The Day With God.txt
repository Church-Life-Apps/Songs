[v1]
 Begin the day with God! 
 He is thy Sun and Day! 
 His is the radiance of thy dawn; 
 To Him address thy lay.
[v2]
 Sing a new song at morn! 
 Join the glad woods and hills; 
 Join the fresh winds and seas and plains, 
 Join the bright flowers and rills.
[v3]
 Sing thy first song to God! 
 Not to thy fellowman; 
 Not to the creatures of His hand, 
 But to the glorious One.
[v4]
 Take thy first walk with God!
 Let Him go forth with thee;
 By stream, or sea, or mountain path,
 Seek still His company.
[v5]
 Thy first transaction be
 With God Himself above!
 So shall thy business prosper well
 And all the day be love.

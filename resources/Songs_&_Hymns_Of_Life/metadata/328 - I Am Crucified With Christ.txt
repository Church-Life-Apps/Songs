[v1]
 I am crucified with Christ, 
 And the cross has set me free; 
 I have ris’n again with Christ, 
 And He lives and reigns in me. 
[v2]
 Myst’ry hid from ancient ages! 
 But at length to faith made plain: 
 Christ in me the Hope of Glory, 
 Tell it o’er and o’er again.
[v3]
 This the secret nature hideth, 
 Harvest grows from buried grain; 
 A poor tree with better grafted, 
 Richer, sweeter life doth gain.
[v4]
 This the secret of the holy, 
 Not our holiness, but Him; 
 O Lord! Empty us and fill us, 
 With Thy fulness to the brim.
[c1]
 Oh! It is so sweet to die with Christ, 
 To the world, and self, and sin; 
 Oh! It is so sweet to live with Christ, 
 As He lives and reigns within.

[v1]
 Jesus, the very thought of Thee 
 With sweetness fills my breast; 
 But sweeter far Thy face to see, 
 And in Thy presence rest.
[v2]
 Nor voice can sing, nor heart can frame, 
 Nor can the mem’ry find 
 A sweeter sound than Thy blest name, 
 O Savior of mankind!
[v3]
 O hope of every contrite heart, 
 O joy of all the meek, 
 To those who fall, how kind Thou art! 
 How good to those who seek!
[v4]
 But what to those who find? Ah, this 
 Nor tongue nor pen can show; 
 The love of Jesus, what it is 
 None but His loved ones know.
[v5]
 O Jesus! light of all below!
 Thou fount of life and fire!
 Surpassing all the joys we know,
 And all we can desire.
[v6]
 No other source have we but Thee,
 Soul-thirst to satisfy.
 Exhaustless spring! the waters free!
 All other streams are dry.
[v7]
 Jesus, our only joy be Thou,
 As Thou our prize wilt be;
 Jesus, be Thou our glory now,
 And through eternity.

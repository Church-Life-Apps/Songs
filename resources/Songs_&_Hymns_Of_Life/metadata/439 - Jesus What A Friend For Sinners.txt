[v1]
 Jesus! what a Friend for sinners! 
 Jesus! Lover of my soul; 
 Friends may fail me, foes assail me, 
 He, my Savior, makes me whole. 
[v2]
 Jesus! what a Strength in weakness! 
 Let me hide myself in Him; 
 Tempted, tried, and sometimes failing, 
 He, my Strength, my vict’ry wins.
[v3]
 Jesus! what a Help in sorrow! 
 While the billows o’er me roll, 
 Even when my heart is breaking, 
 He, my Comfort, helps my soul.
[v4]
 Jesus what a Guide and Keeper!
 While the tempest still is high,
 Storms about me, night o’ertakes me,
 He, my Pilot, hears my cry.
[v5]
 Jesus! I do now receive Him,
 More than all in Him I find;
 He hath granted me forgiveness,
 I am His, and He is mine.
[c1]
 Hallelujah! what a Savior! 
 Hallelujah! what a Friend! 
 Saving, helping, keeping, loving, 
 He is with me to the end.

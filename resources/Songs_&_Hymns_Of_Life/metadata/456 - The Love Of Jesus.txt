[v1]
 There is no love like the love of Jesus, 
 Never to fade or fall, 
 Till into the rest of the house of God 
 He has gathered us all. 
[v2]
 There is no heart like the heart of Jesus, 
 Filled with a tender love; 
 No throb nor throe that our hearts can know, 
 But He feels it above.
[v3]
 There is no eye like the eye of Jesus, 
 Piercing so far away; 
 Ne’er out of the sight of its tender light 
 Can the wanderer stray.
[v4]
 There is no voice like the voice of Jesus,
 Tender and sweet its chime;
 Like musical ring of a flowing spring
 In the bright summertime.
[v5]
 Oh, let us hark to the voice of Jesus!
 Oh, may we never roam;
 Till safe we rest on His loving breast,
 In the dear heavenly home.
[c1]
 Jesus’ love, precious love, 
 Boundless, and pure, and free; 
 Oh, turn to that love, weary wand’ring soul; 
 Jesus pleadeth for thee.

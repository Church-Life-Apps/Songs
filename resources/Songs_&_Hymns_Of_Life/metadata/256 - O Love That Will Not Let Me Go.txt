[v1]
 O Love, that will not let me go, 
 I rest my weary soul in Thee; 
 I give Thee back the life I owe, 
 That in Thine ocean depths its flow 
 May richer, fuller be.
[v2]
 O Light, that followest all my way, 
 I yield my flickering torch to Thee; 
 My heart restores its borrowed ray, 
 That in Thy sunshine’s blaze its day 
 May brighter, fairer be.
[v3]
 O Joy, that seekest me through pain, 
 I cannot close my heart to Thee; 
 I trace the rainbow through the rain, 
 And feel the promise is not vain 
 That morn shall tear less be.
[v4]
 O Cross, that liftest up my head, 
 I dare not ask to fly from Thee; 
 I lay in dust life’s glory dead, 
 And from the ground there blossoms red 
 Life that shall endless be.

[v1]
 Thy mighty love, O God, constraineth me, 
 As some strong tide it presses on its way, 
 Seeking a channel in my self-bound soul, 
 Yearning to sweep all barriers away.
[v2]
 Shall I not yield to that constraining power? 
 Shall I not say, O tide of love, flow in? 
 My God, Thy gentleness has conquered me, 
 Life cannot be as it has hither been.
[v3]
 Break through my nature, mighty, heav’nly love, 
 Clear every avenue of thought and brain, 
 Flood my affections, purify my will, 
 Let nothing but Thine own pure life remain.
[v4]
 Thus wholly mastered and possessed by God, 
 Forth from my life, spontaneous and free 
 Shall flow a stream of tenderness and grace, 
 Loving, because God loved, eternally.

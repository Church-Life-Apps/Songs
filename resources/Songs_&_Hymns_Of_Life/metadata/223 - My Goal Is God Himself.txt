[v1]
 My goal is God Himself, not joy, nor peace, 
 Nor even blessing, but Himself, my God; 
 ’Tis His to lead me there— not mine but His— 
 At any cost, dear Lord, by any road.
[v2]
 So faith bounds forward to its goal in God, 
 And love can trust her Lord to lead her there; 
 Upheld by Him, my soul is foll’wing hard 
 Till God hath full fulfilled my deepest prayer.
[v3]
 No matter if the way be sometimes dark, 
 No matter though the cost be oft-times great, 
 He knoweth how I best shall reach the mark, 
 The way that leads to Him must needs be strait.
[v4]
 One thing I know, I cannot say Him nay; 
 One thing I do, I press towards my Lord; 
 My God, my glory here, from day to day, 
 And in the glory there my Great Reward.

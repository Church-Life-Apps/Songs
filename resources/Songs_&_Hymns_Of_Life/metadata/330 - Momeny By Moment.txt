[v1]
 Dying with Jesus, by death reckon’d mine; 
 Living with Jesus a new life divine; 
 Looking to Jesus till glory does shine, 
 Moment by moment, O Lord, I am Thine. 
[v2]
 Never a battle with wrong for the right, 
 Never a contest that He does not fight; 
 Lifting above us His banner so bright; 
 Moment by moment I’m kept in His sight.
[v3]
 Never a trial that He is not there, 
 Never a burden that He does not bear; 
 Never a sorrow that He does not share, 
 Moment by moment, I’m under His care.
[v4]
 Never a heartache, and never a groan,
 Never a teardrop and never a moan;
 Never a danger but there on the throne
 Moment by moment He thinks of His own.
[v5]
 Never a weakness that He does not feel,
 Never a sickness that He cannot heal;
 Moment by moment, in woe or in weal,
 Jesus, my Savior, abides with me still.
[c1]
 Moment by moment I’m kept in His love, 
 Moment by moment I’ve life from above; 
 Looking to Jesus till glory does shine; 
 Moment by moment, O Lord, I am Thine.

[v1]
 It may not be on the mountain’s height, 
 Or over the stormy sea; 
 It may not be at the battle’s front
 My Lord will have need of me; 
 But if by a still small voice He calls 
 To paths I do not know, 
 I’ll answer, dear Lord, with my hand in Thine, 
 I’ll go where You want me to go. 
[v2]
 Perhaps today there are loving words 
 Which Jesus would have me speak; 
 There may be now in the paths of sin 
 Some wand’rer whom I should seek. 
 O Savior, if Thou wilt be my guide, 
 Tho’ dark and rugged the way, 
 My voice shall echo the message sweet, 
 I’ll say what You want me to say.
[v3]
 There’s surely somewhere a lowly place 
 In earth’s harvest fields so wide, 
 Where I may labor through life’s short day 
 For Jesus, the Crucified. 
 So, trusting my all unto Your care— 
 I know You always love me! 
 I’ll do Your will with a heart sincere, 
 I’ll be what You want me to be.
[c1]
 I’ll go where You want me to go, dear Lord, 
 O’er mountain or plain or sea; 
 I’ll say what You want me to say, dear Lord, 
 I’ll be what You want me to be.

[v1]
 Christ our Redeemer died on the cross, 
 Died for the sinner, paid all his due; 
 Sprinkle your soul with the blood of the Lamb, 
 “And I will pass, will pass over you.” 
[v2]
 Chiefest of sinners, Jesus will save; 
 All He has promised, that will He do; 
 Wash in the fountain opened for sin,
 “And I will pass, will pass over you.” 
[v3]
 Judgment is coming, all will be there, 
 Each one receiving justly his due; 
 Hide in the saving, sin-cleansing blood,
 “And I will pass, will pass over you.” 
[v4]
 O great compassion! O boundless love! 
 O loving kindness, faithful and true! 
 Find peace and shelter under the blood,
 “And I will pass, will pass over you.” 
[c1]
 “When I see the blood, When I see the blood, 
 When I see the blood, I will pass, I will pass over you.”

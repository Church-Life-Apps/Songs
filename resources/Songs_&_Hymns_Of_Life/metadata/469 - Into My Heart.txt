[v1]
 Come into my heart, blessed Jesus, 
 Come into my heart, I pray; 
 My soul is so troubled and weary, 
 Come into my heart, today. 
[v2]
 Come into my heart, blessed Jesus, 
 I need Thee thro’ life’s dreary way; 
 The burden of sin is so heavy, 
 Come into my heart to stay.
[v3]
 Come into my heart, blessed Jesus, 
 And take all my guilt away; 
 Then spotless I’ll stand in Thy presence, 
 When breaks Thine eternal day.
[v4]
 Come into my heart, blessed Jesus, 
 Now cleanse and illumine my soul; 
 Fill me with Thy wonderful Spirit, 
 Come in and take full control.
[c1]
 Into my heart, into my heart, 
 Come into my heart, Lord Jesus;  
 Come in today, come in to stay, 
 Come into my heart, Lord Jesus.

[v1]
 And is it so! I shall be like Thy Son? 
 Is this the grace which He for me has won? 
 Father of glory— thought beyond all thought!— 
 In glory, to His own blest likeness brought!
[v2]
 Oh, Jesus, Lord, who loved me like to Thee? 
 Fruit of Thy work, with Thee, too, there to see 
 Thy glory, Lord, while endless ages roll, 
 Myself the prize and travail of Thy soul.
[v3]
 Yet it must be: Thy love had not its rest 
 Were Thy redeemed not with Thee fully blest; 
 That love that gives not as the world, but shares 
 All it possesses with its loved coheirs.
[v4]
 Nor I alone; Thy loved ones all, complete  
 In glory, round Thee there with joy shall meet; 
 All like Thee, for Thy glory like Thee, Lord, 
 Object supreme of all, by all adored.

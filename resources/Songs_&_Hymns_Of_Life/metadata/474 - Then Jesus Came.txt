[v1]
 One sat alone beside the highway begging, 
 His eyes were blind, the light he could not see; 
 He clutched his rags and shivered in the shadows, 
 Then Jesus came and bade his darkness flee. 
[v2]
 From home and friends the evil spirits drove him, 
 Among the tombs he dwelt in misery; 
 He cut himself as demon pow’rs possessed him, 
 Then Jesus came and set the captive free.
[v3]
 “Unclean! unclean!” the leper cried in torment, 
 The deaf, the dumb, in helplessness stood near; 
 The fever raged, disease had gripped its victim, 
 Then Jesus came and cast out every fear.
[v4]
 Their hearts were sad as in the tomb they laid him,
 For death had come and taken him away;
 Their night was dark and bitter tears were falling,
 Then Jesus came and night was turned to day.
[v5]
 So men today have found the Savior able,
 They could not conquer passion, lust and sin;
 Their broken hearts had left them sad and lonely,
 Then Jesus came and dwelt, Himself, within.
[c1]
 When Jesus comes, the tempter’s pow’r is broken; 
 When Jesus comes, the tears are wiped away. 
 He takes the gloom and fills the life with glory, 
 For all is changed when Jesus comes to stay.

[v1]
 I’m pressing on the upward way, 
 New heights I’m gaining every day; 
 Still praying as I onward bound, 
 “Lord, plant my feet on higher ground.” 
[v2]
 My heart has no desire to stay 
 Where doubts arise and fears dismay; 
 Though some may dwell where these abound, 
 My prayer, my aim, is higher ground.
[v3]
 I want to live above the world, 
 Though Satan’s darts at me are hurled; 
 For faith has caught the joyful sound, 
 The song of saints on higher ground.
[v4]
 I want to scale the utmost height 
 And catch a gleam of glory bright; 
 But still I’ll pray till heav’n I’ve found, 
 “Lord, lead me on to higher ground.”
[c1]
 Lord, lift me up, and let me stand 
 By faith on heaven’s tableland; 
 A higher plane than I have found, 
 Lord, plant my feet on higher ground.

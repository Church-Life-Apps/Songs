[v1]
 My hope is built on nothing less 
 Than Jesus’ blood and righteousness; 
 I dare not trust the sweetest frame, 
 But wholly lean on Jesus’ name. 
[v2]
 When darkness veils His lovely face, 
 I rest on His unchanging grace; 
 In every high and stormy gale, 
 My anchor holds within the veil.
[v3]
 His oath, His covenant, His blood, 
 Support me in the whelming flood; 
 When all around my soul gives way, 
 He then is all my Hope and Stay.
[v4]
 When He shall come with trumpet sound, 
 Oh, may I then in Him be found; 
 Dressed in His righteousness alone, 
 Faultless to stand before the throne.
[c1]
 On Christ, the solid Rock, I stand; 
 All other ground is sinking sand; 
 All other ground is sinking sand.

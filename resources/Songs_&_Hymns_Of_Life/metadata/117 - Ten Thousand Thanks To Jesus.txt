[v1]
 Ten thousand thanks to Jesus,
 Whose life our ransom paid, 
 Whose blood a full redemption 
 For all the world has made: 
 Let every heart adore Him; 
 Let every creature sing 
 Ten thousand thanks to Jesus, 
 Our Savior and our King. 
[v2]
 Ten thousand hearts to Jesus 
 How gladly would we give; 
 Ten thousand lives to Jesus, 
 Had we so long to live; 
 Ten thousand tongues shall praise Him, 
 Ten thousand songs ascend 
 To Him, our blest Redeemer, 
 To Him, our dearest Friend.
[v3]
 Ten thousand thanks to Jesus 
 For blessings every hour; 
 Ten thousand times ten thousand, 
 For love’s redeeming pow’r; 
 And when He comes in glory 
 His blessed face we’ll see, 
 His love through endless ages 
 Our sweetest song shall be.
[c1]
 Ten thousand thanks, ten thousand thanks, 
 We’ll praise Him o’er and o’er; 
 And for the life with Him to live, 
 Ten thousand thousand more.

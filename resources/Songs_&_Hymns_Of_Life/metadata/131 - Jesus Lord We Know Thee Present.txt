[V1]
 Jesus, Lord, we know Thee present 
 At Thy table freshly spread, 
 Seated at Thy priceless banquet 
 With Thy banner over head. 
 Precious moments at Thy table, 
 From all fear and doubt set free; 
 Here to rest, so sweetly able, 
 Occupied alone with Thee.
[V2]
 Here rejoicing in Thy nearness, 
 Gladly by Thy Spirit led;  
 Calmly in the blest remembrance 
 Of Thyself, Thy blood once shed.  
 Lord, we take each simple token 
 In fond memory of Thee, 
 Muse upon Thy body broken 
 And Thy blood shed on the tree.
[V3]
 Oh, what joy it is to see Thee, 
 In these chosen emblems   here;   
 In the bread and wine of blessing— 
 Bread to strengthen, wine to cheer! 
 Lord, behold us met together, 
 One in Thee, our risen Head, 
 Thus we take the cup of blessing, 
 Thus we share the broken bread.
[V4]
 Lord, we know how true Thy promise 
 To be with us where we meet,   
 When in Thy loved name we gather 
 To enjoy communion sweet;   
 Dearer still that looked-for promise 
 To each waiting, yearning heart, 
 That with Thee we soon shall be, Lord, 
 Yes, forever where Thou art.

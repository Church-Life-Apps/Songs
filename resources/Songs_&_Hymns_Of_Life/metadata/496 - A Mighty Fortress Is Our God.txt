[V1]
 A mighty fortress is our God, 
 A bulwark never failing; 
 Our helper He amid the flood 
 Of mortal ills prevailing: 
 For still our ancient foe 
 Doth seek to work us woe; 
 His craft and pow’r are great,
 And, armed with cruel hate, 
 On earth is not his equal.
[V2]
 Did we in our own strength confide, 
 Our striving would be losing; 
 Were not the right Man on our side, 
 The Man of God’s own choosing: 
 Dost ask who that may be? 
 Christ Jesus, it is He; 
 Lord Sabaoth His Name, 
 From age to age the same, 
 And He must win the battle.
[V3]
 And though this world, with devils filled, 
 Should threaten to undo us, 
 We will not fear, for God hath willed 
 His truth to triumph through us: 
 The prince of darkness grim, 
 We tremble not for him; 
 His rage we can endure, 
 For lo! his doom is sure, 
 One little word shall fell him.
[V4]
 That word above all earthly pow’rs, 
 No thanks to them, abideth; 
 The Spirit and the gifts are ours 
 Through Him who with us sideth: 
 Let goods and kindred go, 
 This mortal life also; 
 The body they may kill: 
 God’s truth abideth still,
 His Kingdom is forever.

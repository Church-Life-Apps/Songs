[v1]
 Cleansed in our Savior’s precious blood, 
 Filled with the fulness of our God, 
 Walking by faith the path He trod, 
 Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
[v2]
 Leaning our heads on Jesus’ breast,
 Knowing the joy of that sweet rest, 
 Finding in Him the chief, the best,
 Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
[v3]
 Kept by His pow’r from day to day, 
 Held by His hand, we cannot stray, 
 Glory to glory all the way,
 Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
[v4]
 Living in us His own pure life,
 Giving us rest from inward strife,
 From strength to strength, from death to life,
 Hallelujah! Hallelujah!  
[v5]
 O what a Savior we have found!
 Well may we make the world resound
 With one continual joyous sound,
 Hallelujah! Hallelujah!

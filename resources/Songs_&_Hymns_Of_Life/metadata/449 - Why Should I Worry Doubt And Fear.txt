[v1]
 Why should I worry, doubt and fear? 
 Has God not caused His Son to bear 
 My sins upon the tree? 
 The debt that Christ for me has paid, 
 Would God another mind have made 
 To claim again from me?
[v2]
 Redemption full the Lord has made, 
 And all my debts has fully paid, 
 From law to set me free. 
 I fear not for the wrath of God, 
 For I’ve been sprinkled with His blood, 
 It wholly covers me.
[v3]
 For me forgiveness He has gained, 
 And full acquittal was obtained, 
 All debts of sin are paid; 
 God would not have His claim on two, 
 First on His Son, my Surety true, 
 And then upon me laid.
[v4]
 So now I have full peace and rest, 
 My Savior Christ has done the best 
 And set me wholly free; 
 By His all-efficacious blood 
 I ne’er could be condemned by God, 
 For He has died for me!

[v1]
 I belong to Jesus; 
 I am not my own; 
 All I have and all I am 
 Shall be His alone.
[v2]
 I belong to Jesus; 
 He is Lord and King, 
 Reigning in my inmost heart 
 Over everything.
[v3]
 I belong to Jesus;  
 What can hurt or harm, 
 When He folds around my soul
 His almighty arm?
[v4]
 I belong to Jesus; 
 Blessed, blessed thought! 
 With His own most precious blood 
 Has my soul been bought.
[v5]
 I belong to Jesus;
 He has died for me;
 I am His and He is mine
 Through eternity.
[v6]
 I belong to Jesus;
 He will keep my soul,
 If the deathly waters dark
 Round about me roll.
[v7]
 I belong to Jesus;
 And ere long I’ll be
 With my precious Savior there
 In His royalty.

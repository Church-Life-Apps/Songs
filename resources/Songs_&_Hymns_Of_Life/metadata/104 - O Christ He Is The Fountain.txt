[v1]
 O Christ, He is the fountain, 
 The deep sweet well of life: 
 Its living streams I’ve tasted 
 Which save from grief and strife. 
 And to an ocean fulness, 
 His mercy doth expand; 
 His grace is all-sufficient 
 As by His wisdom planned.
[v2]
 O I am my Beloved’s, 
 And my Beloved’s mine! 
 He brings a poor vile sinner 
 Into His "house of wine." 
 I stand upon His merit; 
 I know no other stand. 
 I’m hidden in His presence 
 And held by His own hand.
[v3]
 The Bride eyes not her garment, 
 But her dear Bridegroom’s face; 
 I will not gaze at glory, 
 But on my King of grace: 
 Not at the crown He giveth, 
 But on His pierced hand;  
 The Lamb is all the glory, 
 And my eternal stand!

[v1]
 Many nights while on my bed, 
 I sought Him whom my soul loved for years; 
 I sought Him, but I found Him not, 
 I should go out and seek. 
 O brothers would you tell me please, 
 Where did my heart’s beloved go? 
 That I may run and bring Him back, 
 His love to enjoy once again. 
 Brothers, lead me. You are my guides 
 That in fellowship true I’d abide. 
 Oh! My love is now by my side, 
 Never from me did hide.
[v2]
 Oh, how could I be Your belov’d, 
 Filled with Spirit like pillars of smoke? 
 Resurrected, to death conformed, 
 Myrrh and frankincense show. 
 O how could I be Your palanquin, 
 That through me You may move and rest? 
 As one of Israel’s mighty men, 
 From terror to guard in the night. 
 All around me are those who watch, 
 I am safe and securely I dwell. 
 Love, immeasur’able, poured on me, 
 In Your likeness I’m formed.
[v3]
 To the mountain of myrrh I go, 
 All that’s mine I put to death; 
 Hill of frankincense I’d ascend, 
 Shadows flee away. 
 My beauty You proclaimed most fair, 
 The best love You enjoyed from me; 
 Your heart I’ve ravished with one glance, 
 My ointments excelling all spices. 
 Lebanon, I come willingly, 
 Called to live in ascension with Him; 
 Yet in Hermon I’ll also dwell, 
 As I boast in Your cross.
[v4]
 May the honey from my lips 
 Be for You the sweetness of love. 
 May the fragrance of Lebanon 
 From my living outflow. 
 O Lord, I beg You, quickly come, 
 My being’s occupied by You, 
 A garden closed, a spring shut up, 
 A fountain sealed all for Yourself. 
 Wake, O north wind and come, O south, 
 From my garden the spices do flow, 
 To Your garden O come, Belov’d, 
 All its fruit to enjoy.

[v1]
 Precious, precious blood of Jesus, 
 Shed on Calvary; 
 Shed for rebels, shed for sinners, 
 Shed for thee. 
[v2]
 Precious, precious blood of Jesus, 
 Let it make thee whole; 
 Let it flow in mighty cleansing, 
 O’er thy soul.
[v3]
 Though thy sins are red like crimson, 
 Deep in scarlet glow, 
 Jesus’ precious blood shall wash thee, 
 White as snow.
[v4]
 Precious blood that has redeemed us!
 All the price is paid;
 Perfect pardon now is offered,
 Peace is made.
[v5]
 Now the holiest with boldness
 We may enter in;
 For the open fountain cleanseth
 From all sin.
[v6]
 Precious blood, by this we conquer
 In the fiercest fight,
 Sin and Satan overcoming
 By its might.
[v7]
 Precious blood whose full redemption
 Makes us nigh to God;
 Precious blood, our way of glory,
 Praise and laud.
[c1]
 Precious, precious blood of Jesus 
 Ever flowing free; 
 Oh, believe it; oh, receive it, 
 ’Tis for thee.

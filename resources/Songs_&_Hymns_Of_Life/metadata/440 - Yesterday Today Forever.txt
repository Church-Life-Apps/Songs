[v1]
 O how sweet the glorious message, 
 Simple faith may claim; 
 Yesterday, today, forever, 
 Jesus is the same. 
 Still He loves to save the sinful, 
 Heal the sick and lame; 
 Cheer the mourner, still the tempest; 
 Glory to His name! 
[v2]
 He who was the friend of sinners, 
 Seeks thee, lost one, now; 
 Sinner, come, and at His footstool, 
 Penitently bow. 
 He who said, “I’ll not condemn thee, 
 Go and sin no more,” 
 Speaks to thee that word of pardon, 
 As in days of yore.
[v3]
 Oft on earth He healed the suff’rer, 
 By His mighty hand; 
 Still our sicknesses and sorrows, 
 Go at His command. 
 He who gave His healing virtue, 
 To a woman’s touch; 
 To the faith that claims His fulness, 
 Still will give as much.
[v4]
 As of old He walked to Emmaus, 
 With them to abide; 
 So through all life’s way He walketh, 
 Ever near our side. 
 Soon again we shall behold Him, 
 Hasten, Lord, the day! 
 But ’twill still be “this same Jesus,” 
 As He went away.
[c1]
 Yesterday, today, forever, Jesus is the same, 
 All may change, but Jesus never! 
 Glory to His name! 
 Glory to His name! Glory to His name! 
 All may change, but Jesus never! 
 Glory to His name!
